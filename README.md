# Disaster Management UI
<p>In the recent few years, there has been a upsurge in the number of nuclear
disasters and nuclear accidents. We, at <strong><i><u>Vision in Fission</i></u></strong> aim to be a
helping hand to people at these crucial and difficult times of disaster. Helping
hands are better than praying lips is our moto which is a driving force for our
website. Completely designed using web development, it has been made
extremely user-friendly and convenient.
The first is a homepage that displays about nuclear accidents, the various <strong>DO’S
and DONT’S</strong> and also assists you in making an emergency kit !
We have also added few links and videos that would help users understand how
to prepare in these times and the various precautions.
Our second and most important component is the <strong>AMBULANCE LOCATOR.</strong>
This is our unique idea. Ambulance Locator tracks your current location and on
request for an ambulance, it lists you out all the available nearby pharmacy and
hospitals. This is extremely easy to use and just asks for a few basic
authentication details.
Our third component is <strong>DONATE NOW.</strong> Donations are really important during
these times. Through a safe, extremely secure and convenient to handle
payment method, the DONATE NOW has been designed to accept donations. It
also displays the amount already collected so far, number of volunteers there
and how far are we from acheiving our goal.
We welcome all to be a part of our initiative and our website and help those
really in need in these tough times. JOIN US is a section through which anyone
can be a part of our part and help us assisting the same! Through a simple form
and by filling it out, anyone can be a part of our team!
Let us all join hands and be a helping hand, today!</p><br>
